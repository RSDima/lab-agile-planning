  abstract = {In academia lecturers are often appointed based on their research profile and not their teaching and learning (T&L) experience. Although universities do emphasize T&L, it might often not even be mentioned during interviews. In the field of education lecturers are more aware of using tools such as Bloom’s Taxonomy during their T&L activities. However, in the field of information systems limited academic papers are available on how lecturers can align their goals with the assessment in their courses. In this paper Bloom’s Taxonomy Table was used to evaluate the alignment of goals of the case and the assessment done on a fourth-year level subject offered in the information systems field. The purpose of the paper was firstly to reflect on the practice of using Bloom’s Taxonomy Table as an evaluation tool and then secondly to provide a set of guidelines for lecturers who want to use Bloom’s Taxonomy Table in alignment studies.},

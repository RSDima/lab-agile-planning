  title = {Belief Change in Human Reasoning: An Empirical Investigation on MTurk},
  abstract = {Belief revision and belief update are approaches to represent and reason with knowledge in artificial intelligence. Previous empirical studies have shown that human reasoning is consistent with non-monotonic logic and postulates of defeasible reasoning, belief revision and belief update. We extended previous work, which tested natural language translations of the postulates of defeasible reasoning, belief revision and belief update with human reasoners via surveys, in three respects.
Firstly, we only tested postulates of belief revision and belief update, taking the position that belief change aligns more with human reasoning than non-monotonic defeasible reasoning. Secondly, we decomposed the postulates of revision and update into material implication statements of the form “If x is the case, then y is the case”, each containing a premise
and a conclusion, and then translated the premises and conclusions into natural language. Thirdly, we asked human participants to judge each component of the postulate for plausibility. In our analysis, we measured the strength of the association between the premises and the conclusion of each postulate. We used Possibility theory to determine whether the postulates hold with our participants in general. Our results showed that our participants’ reasoning is consistent with postulates of belief
revision and belief update when judging the premises and conclusion of the postulate separately.},

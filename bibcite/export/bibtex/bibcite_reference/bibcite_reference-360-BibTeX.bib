  title = {Using Defeasible Information to Obtain Coherence},
  abstract = {We consider the problem of obtaining coherence in a propositional knowledge base using techniques from Belief Change. Our motivation comes from the ﬁeld of formal ontologies where coherence is interpreted to mean that a concept name has to be satisﬁable. In the propositional case we consider here, this translates to a propositional formula being satisﬁable. We deﬁne belief change operators in a framework of nonmonotonic preferential reasoning. We show how the introduction of defeasible information using contraction operators can be an effective means for obtaining coherence.},

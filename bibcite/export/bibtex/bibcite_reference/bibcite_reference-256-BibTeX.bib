  title = {Computational Ontologies as Classification Artifacts in IS Research},
  abstract = {Based on previous work on classification in IS research, this paper reports on an experimental investigation into the use of computational ontologies as classification artifacts, given the classification approaches identified in information systems (IS) research. The set-theoretical basis of computational ontologies ensures particular suitability for classification functions, and classification was identified as an accepted approach to develop contributions to IS research. The main contribution of the paper is a set of guidelines that IS researchers could use when adopting a classification approach and constructing an ontology as the resulting classification artifact. The guidelines were extracted by mapping an ontology construction approach to the classification approaches of IS research. Ontology construction approaches have been developed in response to the significant adoption of computational ontologies in the broad field of computing and IS since the acceptance of the W3C standards for ontology languages. These W3C standards also resulted in the development of tools such as ontology editors and reasoners. The advantages of using computational ontologies as classification artifacts thus include standardized representation, as well as the availability of associated technologies such as reasoners that could, for instance, ensure that implicit assumptions are made explicit and that the ontology is consistent and satisfiable. The research results from this experimental investigation extend the current work on classification in IS research.},

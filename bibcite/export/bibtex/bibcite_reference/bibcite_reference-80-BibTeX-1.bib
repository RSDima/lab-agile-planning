  title = {TBox abduction in ALC using a DL tableau},
  abstract = {The formal definition of abduction asks what needs to be
added to a knowledge base to enable an observation to be entailed. TBox
abduction in description logics (DLs) asks what TBox axioms need to
be added to a DL knowledge base to allow a TBox axiom to be entailed.
We describe a sound and complete algorithm, based on the standard DL
tableau, that takes a TBox abduction problem in ALC and generates
solutions in a restricted language. We then show how this algorithm can
be enhanced to deal with a broader range of problems in ALC.},

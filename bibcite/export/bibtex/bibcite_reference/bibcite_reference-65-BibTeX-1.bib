  title = {A Preferential Proposal for Contextual Reasoning},
  abstract = {In recent years disciplines such as psychology, cognitive sciences and philosophy of mind have proposed alternative models to the classical view of conceptualization, that is traditionally centered on the role of definitions. Classical logic and classical set theory are no longer considered adequate tools for the formalization of the conceptual structures introduced by such new proposals.
In this paper, starting from a recent work by Michael Freund, we present a logical formalization for a theory of concepts where notions such as stereotypical properties and context play a central role.},

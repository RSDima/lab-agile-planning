  title = {Requirements of a Security Framework for the Semantic Web},
  abstract = {The vision of the Semantic Web is to provide the World Wide Web the ability to automate interoperate and reason about resources and services on the Web. However, the autonomous dynamic open distributed and heterogeneous nature of the Semantic Web introduce new security challenges. Consequently, security becomes a crucial factor for the adoption of the Semantic Web. There are existing suggested security frameworks for the Semantic Web, however none of these address all issues related to the Semantic Web, neither have any requirements for such frameworks been established. Common criteria are therefore required to evaluate existing security frameworks. In this paper, the authors suggest a set of evaluation criteria that can be used to evaluate existing Semantic Web security frameworks},

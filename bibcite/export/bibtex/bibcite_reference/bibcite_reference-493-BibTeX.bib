  title = {Investigating Ontology-based Data Access with GitHub},
  abstract = {Data analysis-based decision-making is performed daily by
domain experts. As data grows, getting access to relevant data becomes a
challenge. In an approach known as Ontology-based data access (OBDA), AQ1
ontologies are advocated as a suitable formal tool to address complex
data access. This technique combines a domain ontology with a data
source by using a declarative mapping specification to enable data access
using a domain vocabulary.We investigate this approach by studying the
theoretical background; conducting a literature review on the implementation
of OBDA in production systems; implementing OBDA on a relational
dataset using an OBDA tool and; providing results and analysis of
query answering.We selected Ontop (https://ontop-vkg.org) to illustrate
how this technique enhances the data usage of the GitHub community. AQ2
Ontop is an open-source OBDA tool applied in the domain of relational
databases. The implementation consists of the GHTorrent dataset and
an extended SemanGit ontology. We perform a set of queries to highlight
a subset of the features of this data access approach. The results look
positive and can assist various use cases related to GitHub data with
a semantic approach. OBDA does provide benefits in practice, such as
querying in domain vocabulary and making use of reasoning over the
axioms in the ontology. However, the practical impediments we observe
are in the “manual” development of a domain ontology and the creation
of a mapping specification which requires deep knowledge of a domain
and the data. Also, implementing OBDA within the practical context
of an information system requires careful consideration for a suitable
user interface to facilitate the query construction from ontology vocabulary.
Finally, we conclude with a summary of the paper and direction
for future research.},

  title = {Module-theoretic properties of reachability modules for SRIQ},
  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the module-theoretic properties of bot and top-reachability modules in terms of inseparability relations for the DL SRIQ. We show that, although these modules are not depleting or self-contained, they share the robustness properties of syntactic locality modules and preserve all justifications for an entailment. },

  title = {Explanation for KLM-Style Defeasible Reasoning},
  abstract = {Explanation services are a crucial aspect of symbolic reasoning systems but they have not been explored in detail for defeasible formalisms such as KLM. We evaluate prior work on the topic with a focus on KLM propositional logic and find that a form of defeasible explanation initially described for Rational Closure which we term weak justification can be adapted to Relevant and Lexicographic Closure as well as described in terms of intuitive properties derived from the KLM postulates. We also consider how a more general definition of defeasible explanation known as strong explanation applies to KLM and propose an algorithm that enumerates these justifications for Rational Closure.},

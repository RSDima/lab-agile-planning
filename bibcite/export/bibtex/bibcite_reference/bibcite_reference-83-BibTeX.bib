  title = {Extending ontology development methodologies with foundational ontologies},
  abstract = {From studies, it is clear that using a foundational ontology for domain ontology development is beneficial in theory and practice. However, when it is to be used, developers don't know which one to choose and why. In order to solve this problem, a comprehensive set of criteria that in influence foundational ontology selection has been compiled and a corresponding software tool has been developed to help a domain ontology developer to choose one. This report presents ONSET: a tool used for foundational ontology selection in domain ontology development. Based on an ontology developer's preferences such as ontological commitments, representation languages and other factors, ONSET selects an appropriate foundational ontology to be used for the domain ontology to be developed.},

  title = {Framework for the Cultivation of a Military Cybersecurity Culture},
  abstract = {Most military forces recognise the importance and the challenges of cyber as an operational domain. In addition to specialised cyber units, cyber is present in every division and arms of service as a result the military face increasing risks from cyber threats. It is thus crucial to establish and maintain a capability to ensure cybersecurity. Most organisations purchase and use technical controls to counter cyber threats, but users are considered the weakest link in maintaining cybersecurity, even if they are cyber aware.  The cultivation of a cybersecurity culture has been shown to be the best approach to address human behaviour in the cyber domain. The development and fostering of an organisational cybersecurity culture is receiving increasing attention. This paper gives an overview of existing frameworks and guidelines in this regard and applies these approaches to the military environment. The military environment differs markedly from a business environment in terms of the nature of their work and traditional military culture. The paper proposes a framework for a military force to cultivate and foster a cybersecurity culture within the traditional military culture. This framework has to be tested in a military environment.},

  title = {Towards a semantic web layered architecture},
  abstract = {Tim Berners-Lee proposed a layered architecture for the languages of the Semantic Web in 2000 and suggested an adapted architecture in 2003. We evaluated the architecture according to a list of layered architecture characteristics and in this paper, based on aforementioned evaluation, we propose an adapted layered architecture for the languages of the Semantic Web based on fundamental aspects for layered architectures in information systems.},

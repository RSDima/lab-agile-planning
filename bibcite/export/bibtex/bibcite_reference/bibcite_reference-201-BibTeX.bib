  title = {The Output Size Problem for String-to-Tree Transducers},
  abstract = {The output size problem, for a string-to-tree transducer, is to determine the asymptotic behavior of the function describing the maximum size of output trees, with respect to the length of input strings. We show that the problem to determine, for a given regular expression, the worst-case matching time of a backtracking regular expression matcher, can be reduced to the output size problem. The latter can, in turn, be solved by determining the degree of ambiguity of a non-deterministic finite automaton. 

Keywords: string-to-tree transducers, output size, backtracking regular expression matchers, NFA ambiguity},

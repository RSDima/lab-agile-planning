  title = {Language Fuzzing with Name Binding},
  abstract = {The language fuzzing with name binding project generates syntactically valid test programs that exercise the name binding semantics of a language processor. We introduce generation algorithm and a tool, NameFuzz, for the test suite generation. It achieves this by by parsing in a ANTLR grammar representing the context free grammar of the language, along with the languageâ€™s name binding rules in the NaBL meta-language. The test sentences are intended to be either accepted (positive test cases) or rejected (failing test cases) by the language processor. The intention is to promote confidence in the language processor as far as semantic correctness is concerned. The generated test suite in syntactically correct, but the limitations of not taking type checking into account or having a method to evaluate expressions lead to a large number of test sentences that are semantically incorrect. To a degree these limitations are overcome by the combinatorial nature of the generation algorithm that ensures that each possible type correct sentence is generated as well.},

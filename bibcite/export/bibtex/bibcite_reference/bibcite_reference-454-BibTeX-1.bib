  title = {Demonstrating Approach Design Principles during the Development of a DEMO-based Enterprise Engineering Approach},
  abstract = {Enterprise engineering (EE) aims to address several phenomena in the evolution of an enterprise. One prominent phenomenon is the inability of the enterprise as a complex socio-technical system to adapt to rapidly-changing environments. In response to this phenomenon, many enterprise design approaches (with their own methodologies, frameworks, and modelling languages) emerged, but with little empirical evidence about their effectiveness. Furthermore, research indicates that multiple enterprise design approaches are used concurrently in industry, with each approach focusing on a sub-set of stakeholder concerns. The proliferating design approaches do not necessarily explicate their conditional use in terms of contextual prerequisites and demarcated design scope; and this also impairs their evaluation. Previous work suggested eleven design principles that would guide approach designers when they design or enhance an enterprise design approach. The design principles ensure that researchers contribute to the systematic growth of the EE knowledge base. This article provides a demonstration of the eleven principles during the development of a DEMO-based enterprise engineering approach, as well as a discussion to reflect on the usefulness of the principles},

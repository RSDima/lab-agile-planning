  abstract = {Cybercrime is increasing at a rate few individuals would have predicted. IBM estimated in 2016 that, in 2019, the cost of cybercrime would reach $2 trillion, a threefold increase from the 2015 estimate of $500 billion. The growth of the Internet and the rapid development of technology provide enormous economic and social benefits but at the same time provide platforms for cybercriminals to exploit. Organised crime is using more sophisticated techniques, which require highly skilled and specialised law enforcement responses. One example is the use of cryptocurrencies, which makes it easier for cybercriminals to hide their proceeds. Regulatory measures often lag behind.
In this paper, the authors give an overview of the growing threat of cybercrime with a specific focus on high levels of cybercrime in Africa. The focus then turns to the development of national cybercrime strategies and implementation. Results from literature and the authorsâ€™ analyses of two cyber indices to measure the capabilities and capacities of countries are combined to present a framework for the development of a cybercrime strategy, and in particular, a strategy customised for African countries.},

  title = {The Detection of Conversation Patterns in South African Political Tweets through Social Network Analysis},
  abstract = {Within complex societies, social communities are distinguishable based on social interactions. The interactions can be between members or communities and can range from simple conversations between family members and friends to complex interactions that represent the flow of money, information, or power. In our modern digital society, social media platforms present unique opportunities to study social networks through social network analysis (SNA). Social media platforms are usually representative of a specific user group, and Twitter, a microblogging platform, is characterised by the fast distribution of news and often provocative opinions, as well as social mobilizing, which makes it popular for political interactions. The nature of Twitter generates a valuable SNA data source for investigating political conversations and communities, and in related research, specific archetypal conversation patterns between communities were identified that allow for unique interpretations of conversations about a topic. This paper reports on a study where social network analysis (SNA) was performed on Twitter data about political events in 2021 in South Africa. The purpose was to determine which distinct conversation patterns could be detected in datasets collected, as well as what could be derived from these patterns given the South African political landscape and perceptions. The results indicate that conversations in the South African political landscape are less polarized than expected. Conversations often manifest broadcast patterns from key influencers in addition to tight crowds or community clusters. Tight crowds or community clusters indicate intense conversation across communities that exhibits diverse opinions and perspectives on a topic. The results may be of value for researchers that aim to understand social media conversations within the South African society.},

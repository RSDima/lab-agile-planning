  title = {Data-driven Enterprise Architecture and the TOGAF ADM Phases},
  abstract = {This paper investigates how Data as a disruptive technology could be integrated into TOGAF. Given the recent attention of Big Data and Data Science as disruptors, this paper investigates what the impact on the enterprise could be and how Enterprise Architecture (EA) should accommodate data to enable data-driven EA. There is no model currently available that investigates how Big Data can be incorporated into data-driven EA solutions. This study specifically focuses on how the TOGAF ADM could support a data-driven enterprise. Through document analysis and a systematic literature review, a specific adaption of the TOGAF ADM is proposed that indicates the influence that Data and Big Data has on each phase within the ADM.},

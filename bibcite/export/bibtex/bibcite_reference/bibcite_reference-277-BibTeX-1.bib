  title = {Evaluating acoustic modelling of lexical stress for Afrikaans speech synthesis},
  abstract = {An explicit lexical stress feature is investigated for statistical parametric speech synthesis in Afrikaans: Firstly, objective measures are used to assess proposed annotation protocols and dictionaries compared to the baseline (implicit modelling) on the Lwazi 2 text-to-speech corpus. Secondly, the best candidates are evaluated on additional corpora. Finally, a comparative subjective evaluation is conducted to determine the perceptual impact on text-to-speech synthesis. The best candidate dictionary is associated with favourable objective results obtained on all corpora and was preferred in the subjective test. This suggests that it may form a basis for further refinement and work on improved prosodic models.},

  title = {On Regular Expressions with Backreferences and Transducers},
  abstract = {Modern regular expression matching software features many extensions, some general while some are very narrowly specied. Here we consider the generalization of adding a class of operators which can be described by, e.g. nite-state transducers. Combined with backreferences they enable new classes of languages to be matched. The addition of nite-state transducers is shown to make membership testing undecidable. Following this result, we study the complexity of membership testing for various restricted cases of the model.},

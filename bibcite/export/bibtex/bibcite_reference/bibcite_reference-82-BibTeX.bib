  title = {Towards a Theory of Dilation},
  abstract = {We investigate the notion of dilation of a propositional theory based
on neighbourhoods in a generalized approximation space.We take both a semantic
and a syntactic approach in order to define a suitable notion of theory dilation
in the context of approximate reasoning on the one hand, and a generalized notion
of forgetting in propositional logic on the other hand. We place our work in
the context of existing theories of approximation spaces and forgetting, and show
that neighbourhoods obtained by combining collective and selective dilation provide
a suitable semantic framework within which to reason computationally with
uncertainty in a classical setting.},

  title = {Scaling the ConceptCloud browser to large semi-structured data sets},
  abstract = {Semi-structured data sets such as product reviews or event log data are simultaneously becoming more widely used and growing ever larger. This paper describes ConceptCloud, a flexible interactive browser for semi-structured datasets, with a focus on the recent trend of implementing server-based architectures to accommodate ever growing datasets. ConceptCloud makes use of an intuitive tag cloud visualization viewer in combination with an underlying concept lattice to provide a formal structure for navigation through datasets without prior knowledge of the structure of the data or compromising scalability. This is achieved by implementing architectural changes to increase the systemâ€™s resource efficiency.},

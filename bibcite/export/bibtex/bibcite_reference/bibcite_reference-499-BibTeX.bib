  title = {Security Issues in Cyber Threat Intelligence Exchange: A Review},
  abstract = {The cost and time required by individual organizations to
build an effective cyber defence can become overwhelming with the growing
number of cyber attacks. Hence, the introduction of platforms that
encourage collaborative effort in the fight against cyber attacks is considered
advantageous. However, the acceptability and efficiency of the CTI
exchange platforms is massively challenged by lack of trust caused by
security issues encountered in such communities. This review examines
the security and participation cost issues revolving around the willingness
of participants to either join or actively participate in CTI exchange communities
and proposed solutions to the security issues from the research
perspective.},

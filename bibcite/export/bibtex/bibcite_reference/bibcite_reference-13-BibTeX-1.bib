  title = {An Exploratory Survey of Design Science Research among South African Computing Scholars},
  abstract = {The debate ensues as to whether the traditional focus of
computing research on theory development and verification and
therefore has adequate immediate practical relevance. Despite
increasing claims of the potential of design science research
(DSR) to enhance the utility of the IT artifact and consequently
practical relevance of research, many computing researchers seem
to be reticent to accept this paradigm as a legitimate form of
scholarly research. DSR is a relatively new paradigm in
computing and little is known about its uptake in South Africa. In
this paper, we investigate the opinions about DSR among South
African computing scholars. Findings from a survey of 53
respondents indicate low adoption rates. The paper also
investigates some of the key barriers preventing the uptake of
DSR. The paper concludes with some implications as well as
suggestions for building a local DSR community.},

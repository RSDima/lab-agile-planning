  title = {Reachability modules for the Description Logic SRIQ},
  abstract = { In this paper we investigate module extraction for the Description Logic SRIQ. We formulate modules in terms of the reachability problem for directed hypergraphs. Using inseparability relations, we
investigate the module-theoretic properties of reachability modules and
show by means of an empirical evaluation that these modules have the
potential of being substantially smaller than syntactic locality modules.},

  title = {ABox abduction in ALC using a DL tableau},
  abstract = {The formal definition of abduction asks what needs to be added to a knowledge base to enable an observation to be entailed by the knowledge base. ABox abduction in description logics (DLs) asks what ABox statements need to be added to a DL knowledge base to allow an observation (also in the form of ABox statements) to be entailed. Klarman et al. have provided an algorithm for performing ABox abduction in the description logic ALC by converting the knowledge base and observation to first-order logic, using a connection tableau to obtain abductive solutions, and then converting these back to DL syntax. In this paper we describe how this can be done directly using a DL tableau.},

  title = {An Approach to Qualitative Belief Change Modulo Ontic Strength},
  abstract = {Sometimes, strictly choosing between belief revision and belief update is inadequate in a dynamical, uncertain environment. Boutilier combined the two notions to allow updates in response to external changes to inform an agent about its prior beliefs. His approach is based on ranking functions. Rens proposed a new method to trade off probabilistic revision and update, in proportion to the agent’s confidence for whether to revise or update. In this paper, we translate Rens’s approach from a probabilistic setting to a setting with ranking functions. Given the translation, we are able to compare Boutilier’s and Rens’s approaches.We found that Rens’s approach is an extension of Boutilier’s.},

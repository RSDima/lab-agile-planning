            <p>Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, the first digital currency, and due to the rapid growth of Bitcoin, there is significant interest in blockchain as the enabler of digital currencies due to the consensus distributed ledger model. The rise and the success of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple has supported the development of blockchain technology, but the performance of blockchain applications has been documented as a significant obstacle for adoption. At the core of blockchain is a consensus protocol, which plays a key role in maintaining the safety, performance and efficiency of the blockchain network. Several consensus protocols exist, and the use of the right consensus protocol is crucial to ensure adequate performance of any blockchain application. However, there is a lack of documented overview studies even though there is agreement in the literature about the importance and understanding of blockchain consensus protocols. In this study, we adopt a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate the current status of consensus protocols used for blockchain together with the identified limitations of these protocols. The results of this study include an overview of different consensus protocols as well as consensus protocol limitations and will be of value for any practitioner or scholar that is interested in blockchain applications.</p>

The rise and the success of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple has supported the development of blockchain technology, but the performance of blockchain applications has been documented as a significant obstacle for adoption. At the core of blockchain is a consensus protocol, which plays a key role in maintaining the safety, performance and efficiency of the blockchain network. Several consensus protocols exist, and the use of the right consensus protocol is crucial to ensure adequate performance of any blockchain application. However, there is a lack of documented overview studies even though there is agreement in the literature about the importance and understanding of blockchain consensus protocols. In this study, we adopt a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate the current status of consensus protocols used for blockchain together with the identified limitations of these protocols. The results of this study include an overview of different consensus protocols as well as consensus protocol limitations and will be of value for any practitioner or scholar that is interested in blockchain applications.&#125;,

            <p>Enterprise Architecture (EA) has had an interesting and often controversial history since its inception in the late 80’s by pioneers such as John Zachman.

The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and/or prescribe and it could be argued that EA often conform to these purposes. Using the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor, we motivate that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. Positioning ZFEA as IS explanatory theory provides insight into the role and purpose of the ZFEA (and by extension EA), and could assist researchers and practitioners with mediating the challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations.</p>

            <p>Understanding and explaining small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) growth is important for sustainability from multiple perspectives. Research indicates that SMEs comprise more than 80% of most economies, and their cumulative impact on sustainability considerations is far from trivial. In addition, for sustainability concerns to be prioritized, an SME has to be successful over time. In most developing countries, SMEs play a major role in solving socio-economic challenges. SMEs are an active research topic within the information systems (IS) discipline, often within the enterprise architecture (EA) domain. EA fundamentally adopts a systems perspective to describe the essential elements of a socio-technical organization and their relationships to each other and to the environment in order to understand complexity and manage change. However, despite rapid adoption originally, EA research and practice often fails to deliver on expectations. In some circles, EA became synonymous with projects that are over-budget, over-time and costly without the expected return on investment. In this paper, we argue that EA remains indispensable for understanding and explaining enterprises and that we fundamentally need to revisit some of the applications of EA. We, therefore, executed a research study in two parts. In the first part, we applied IS theory perspectives and adopted the taxonomy and structural components of theory to argue that EA, as represented by the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA), could be adopted as an explanatory IS theory. In the second part of the study, we subsequently analysed multiple case studies from this theoretical basis to investigate whether distinguishable focus patterns could be detected during SME growth. The final results provide evidence that EA, represented through an appropriate framework like the ZFEA, could serve as an explanatory theory for SMEs during start-up, growth and transformation. We identified focus patterns and from these results, it should be possible to understand and explain how SMEs grow.

            <p>Advanced modeling is a challenging endeavor and good tool support is of paramount importance to ensure that the modeling objectives are met through the efficient execution of tasks. Tools for advanced modeling should not just support basic task modeling functionality such as easy-to-use interfaces for model creation, but also advanced task functionality such as consistency checks and analysis queries. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is concerned with the alignment of all aspects of an organization. Modeling plays a crucial role in EA and the matching of the correct tool to enable task execution is vital for enterprises engaged with EA. Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) reflects recent trends that elevate EA toward a strategic management function within organizations. Tool support for EAM would necessarily include the execution of additional and often implicit advanced modeling tasks that support EAM capabilities. In this paper we report on a study that used the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) theory to investigate the extent to which basic and advanced task execution for EAM is supported by technology. We found that four of the six TTF factors fully supported and one partially supported EAM task execution. One factor was inconclusive. This study provided a insight into investigating tool support for EAM related task execution to achieve strategic EAM goals.</p>

In the field of education lecturers are more aware of using tools such as Bloom’s Taxonomy during their T&amp;amp;L activities. However, in the field of information systems limited academic papers are available on how lecturers can align their goals with the assessment in their courses. In this paper Bloom’s Taxonomy Table was used to evaluate the alignment of goals of the case and the assessment done on a fourth-year level subject offered in the information systems field. The purpose of the paper was firstly to reflect on the practice of using Bloom’s Taxonomy Table as an evaluation tool and then secondly to provide a set of guidelines for lecturers who want to use Bloom’s Taxonomy Table in alignment studies.&#125;,

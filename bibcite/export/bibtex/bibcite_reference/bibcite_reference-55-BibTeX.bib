  title = {Toward semantic interoperability with linked foundational ontologies in ROMULUS},
  abstract = {A purpose of a foundational ontology is to solve interoperability issues among ontologies. Many foundational ontologies have been developed, re-introducing the ontology interoperability problem. We address this with the new online foundational ontology repository ROMULUS, in which
DOLCE, BFO and GFO have been aligned. We summarise the alignments, mappings, and logical inconsistencies of the foundational ontologies, and OMULUS's features.},

  title = {ConceptCloud 2.0: Visualisation and exploration of geolocation-rich semi-structured data sets},
  abstract = {ConceptCloud is a flexible interactive tool for exploring, vi- sualising, and analysing semi-structured data sets. It uses a combination of an intuitive tag cloud visualisation with an underlying concept lattice to provide a formal structure for navigation through a data set. Con- ceptCloud 2.0 extends the tool with an integrated map view to exploit the geolocation aspect of data. The toolâ€™s implementation of exploratory search does not require prior knowledge of the structure of the data or compromise on scalability, and provides seamless navigation through the tag cloud and the map viewer.},

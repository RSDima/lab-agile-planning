  title = {Generic process model structures: towards a standard notation for abstract representations},
  abstract = {The identification of process model structures is usually complex and costly. If these structures can be reused across boundaries, this could not only benefit the internal structure of one application domain, but could also benefit organizations where it is not feasible to initiate expensive process re-engineering innovations. Furthermore, a reusable process is not worth much if the process is not available. The preservation and availability of objects are therefore important, through libraries in the case of objects, or repositories in the case of process models. The creation of the MIT Process Handbook was a step in this direction. However, although the authors used object-oriented concepts in the abstract representations, they did not rigorously apply object-oriented concepts in the abstract representations used in publications on their process repository. Especially in the notation used and reference to specializations, there are some inconsistencies. To address these issues, we suggest the use of polymorphism, where specializations inherit from the generic base process model, and the use of more formal object-oriented notation for defining specialization.},

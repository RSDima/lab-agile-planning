  title = {An Ontology-based Key for Afrotropical Bees},
  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to report on the development of an ontologybased
taxonomic key application that is a first deliverable of a larger project that
has as goal the development of ontology-driven computing solutions for problems
experienced in taxonomy. The ontology-based taxonomic key was developed from
a complex taxonomic data set, namely the Catalogue of Afrotropical Bees. The
key is used to identify the genera of African bees and for this paper we developed
an ontology-based application, that demonstrates that morphological key data can
be captured effectively in a standardised format as an ontology, and furthermore,
even though the ontology-based key provides the same identification results as the
traditional key, this approach allows for several additional advantages that could
support taxonomy in the biological sciences. The morphology ontology for
Afrotropical bees, as well as the key application form the basis of a suite of tools
that we intend to develop to support the taxonomic processes in this domain.},

  title = {A New Approach to Probabilistic Belief Change},
  abstract = {One way for an agent to deal with uncertainty about its beliefs is to maintain a probability distribution over the worlds it believes are possible. A belief change operation may recommend some previously believed worlds to become impossible and some previously disbelieved worlds to become possible. This work investigates how to redistribute probabilities due to worlds being added to and removed from an agentâ€™s belief-state. Two related approaches are proposed and analyzed.},

  title = {A Stochastic Belief Change Framework with an Observation Stream and Defaults as Expired Observations},
  abstract = {A framework for an agent to change its probabilistic beliefs after a stream of noisy observations is received is proposed. Observations which are no longer relevant, become default assumptions until overridden by newer, more prevalent observations. A distinction is made between background and foreground beliefs. Agent actions and environment events are distinguishable and form part of the agent model. It is left up to the agent designer to provide an environment model; a submodel of the agent model. An example of an environment model is provided in the paper, and an example scenario is based on it. Given the particular form of the agent model, several ‘patterns of cognition’ can be identified. An argument is made for four particular patterns.},

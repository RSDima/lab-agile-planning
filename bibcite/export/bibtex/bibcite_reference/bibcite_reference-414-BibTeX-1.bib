  title = {Quo Vadis KLM-style Defeasible Reasoning?},
  abstract = {The field of defeasible reasoning has a variety of frameworks, all of which are constructed with the view of codifying the patterns of common-sense reasoning inherent to human reasoning. One of these frameworks was first described by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor, and is accordingly referred to as the KLM framework. Initially defined in propositional logic, it has since been imported into description and modal logics, and implemented into many defeasible reasoning engines. However, there are many ways in which this framework may be advanced theoretically, and many opportunities for it to be applied. This paper covers some of the most prominent areas of future work and possible applications of this framework, with the intention that anyone who has recently familiarized themselves with this approach may then have an understanding of the kind of work in which they could engage.},

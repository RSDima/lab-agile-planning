  title = {Using CSP to Develop Quality Concurrent Software},
  abstract = {A method for developing concurrent software is advocated that centres
on using CSP to specify the behaviour of the system. A small example problem
is used to illustrate the method. The problem is to develop a simulation system
that keeps track of and reports on the least unique bid of multiple streams of
randomly generated incoming bids. The problemâ€™s required high-level behaviour is
specified in CSP, refined down to the level of interacting processes and then verified
for refinement and behavioural correctness using the FDR refinement checker.
Heuristics are used to map the CSP processes to a GO implementation. Interpretive
reflections are offered of the lessons learned as a result of the exercise.},

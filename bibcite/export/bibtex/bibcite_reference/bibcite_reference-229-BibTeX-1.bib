  title = {Semantic Technologies and Big Data: Analytics for Cyber Defence},
  abstract = {The Governments, military forces and other organisations responsible for cybersecurity deal with
vast amounts of data that has to be understood in order to lead to intelligent decision making. Due
to the vast amounts of information pertinent to cybersecurity, automation is required for processing
and decision making, specifically to present advance warning of possible threats. The ability to detect
patterns in vast data sets, and being able to understanding the significance of detected patterns are
essential in the cyber defence domain. Big data technologies supported by semantic technologies
can improve cybersecurity, and thus cyber defence by providing support for the processing and
understanding of the huge amounts of information in the cyber environment. The term big data
analytics refers to advanced analytic techniques such as machine learning, predictive analysis, and
other intelligent processing techniques applied to large data sets that contain different data types. The
purpose is to detect patterns, correlations, trends and other useful information. Semantic technologies
is a knowledge representation paradigm where the meaning of data is encoded separately from the
data itself. The use of semantic technologies such as logic-based systems to support decision making
is becoming increasingly popular. However, most automated systems are currently based on syntactic
rules. These rules are generally not sophisticated enough to deal with the complexity of decisions
required to be made. The incorporation of semantic information allows for increased understanding and
sophistication in cyber defence systems. This paper argues that both big data analytics and semantic
technologies are necessary to provide counter measures against cyber threats. An overview of the
use of semantic technologies and big data technologies in cyber defence is provided, and important
areas for future research in the combined domains are discussed.},

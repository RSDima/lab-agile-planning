  abstract = {With the development of ICT and the Internet there was barely any inclination that it could transform itself into a pervading revolution which could be misused for criminal activities. Cybercrime is increasing more rapidly than expected. IBM estimated in 2016 that by 2019 the global cost of cybercrime will reach $2 trillion, a threefold increase from the 2015 estimate of $500 billion. Organised crime is using cyber platforms in a much more sophisticated way that requires a highly skilled and specialised law enforcement response. Cryptocurrencies creates the opportunity for criminals to hide proceeds and the use of cryptocurrency mining malware is resulting in cybercriminals believing they are cashing in on unprecedented successes of these currencies. Regulatory has to be updated to effectively respond to unlawful activities relating to cybercrime. A holistic approach must be used by governments to develop a strategy and implementation plan to address the phenomenon of cybercrime for law enforcement.  Currently most African countries address cybercrime in an uncoordinated and fragmented way. This paper presents a framework for African countries to develop and implement a national cybercrime strategy.},

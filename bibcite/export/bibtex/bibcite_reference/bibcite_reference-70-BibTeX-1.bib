  title = {Supraclassical consequence relations tolerating rare counter-examples},
  abstract = {We explore a family of supraclassical consequence relations obtained by varying the criteria according to which counterexamples to
classical entailment may be deemed tolerable. This provides a dierent perspective on the rational consequence relations of nonmonotonic logic,
as well as introducing new kinds of entailment with a diversity of potential contextual applications.},

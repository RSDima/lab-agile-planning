  title = {Using Formal Ontologies in the Development of Countermeasures for Military Aircraft.},
  abstract = {This paper describes the development of an ontology for use
in a military simulation system. Within the military, aircraft represent
a signicant investment and these valuable assets need to be protected
against various threats. An example of such a threat is shoulder-launched
missiles. Such missiles are portable, easy to use and unfortunately, rela-
tively easy to acquire. In order to counter missile attacks, countermea-
sures are deployed on the aircraft. Such countermeasures are developed,
evaluated and deployed with the assistance of modelling and simulation
systems. One such system is the Optronic Scene Simulator, an engineer-
ing tool that is able to model and evaluate countermeasures in such a way
that the results could be used to make recommendations for successful
deployment and use.
The use of formal ontologies is no longer a foreign concept in the support
of information systems. To assist with the simulations performed in the
Optronic Scene Simulator, an ontology, Simtology, was developed. Sim-
tology supports the system in various ways such as providing a shared
vocabulary, improving the understanding of the concepts in the environ-
ment and adding value by providing functionality that improves integra-
tion between system components.},

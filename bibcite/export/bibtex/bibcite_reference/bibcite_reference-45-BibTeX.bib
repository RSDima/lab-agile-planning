  title = {Preferential Role Restrictions},
  abstract = {We extend the Description Logic ALC with preferential role restrictions as class constructs, and argue that preferential universal restriction represents a defeasible version of standard universal restriction. The resulting DL is more expressive without adding to the complexity of TBox reasoning. We present a tableau system to compute TBox entailment, show that this notion of entailment is not sufficient when adding ABoxes, and refine entailment to deal adequately with ABox reasoning.},

  title = {Regular Expressions with Backreferences Re-examined},
  abstract = {Most modern regular expression matching libraries (one of the rare exceptions being Google’s RE2) allow backreferences, operations which bind a substring to a variable allowing it to be matched again verbatim. However, diﬀerent implementations not only vary in the syntax permitted when using backreferences, but both implementations and deﬁnitions in the literature oﬀer up a number of diﬀerent variants on how backreferences match. Our aim is to compare the various ﬂavors by considering the formal languages that each can describe, resulting in the establishment of a hierarchy of language classes. Beyond the hierarchy itself, some complexity results are given, and as part of the eﬀort on comparing language classes new pumping lemmas are established, and old ones extended to new classes.},

  abstract = {We investigate modeling strategies for English code-switched words as found in a Swahili spoken term detection system. Code
switching, where speakers switch language in a conversation, occurs frequently in multilingual environments, and typically deteriorates STD performance. Analysis is performed in the context of the IARPA Babel program which focuses on rapid STD
system development for under-resourced languages. Our results show that approaches that specifically target the modeling of
code-switched words, significantly improve the detection performance of these words.},

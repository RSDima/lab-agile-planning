  abstract = {In this paper we present a new simulator to investigate consensus within organisations, based on organisational
structure, team dynamics, and artefacts. We model agents who can interact with each other and with artefacts,
as well as the mathematical models that govern agent behaviour. We show that for a fixed problem size, there
is a maximum time within which all agents will reach consensus, independent of number of agents. We present
the results from simulating wide ranges of problem sizes and agent group sizes and report on two significant
statistics; the time to reach consensus and the effort to reach consensus. The time to reach consensus has
implications for project delivery timelines, and the effort relates to project economics.},

  title = {Progressive Software Design Tool},
  abstract = {Visualising software can be a tedious and cluttered affair with the design process and development often being out of sync. Some development methodologies even largely do away with the design entirely and focus on short bursts of coding and validation to make sure the project is still on the right track. This document focuses on deriving a methodology and subsequent tool to iteratively and progressively expand concepts, the understanding of the project and development cycles. An existing visualisation is adapted to better suit the needs of the designer by providing the ability to view the project from different layers of abstraction in one concise visualisation.},

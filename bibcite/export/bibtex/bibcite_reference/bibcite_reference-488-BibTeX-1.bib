  abstract = {Building computational models of agents in dynamic, partially observable and stochastic environments is challenging.  We propose a cognitive computational model of sugarcane growers’ daily decision-making to examine sugarcane supply chain complexities.  Growers make decisions based on uncertain weather forecasts; cane dryness; unforeseen emergencies; and the mill’s unexpected call for delivery of a different amount of cane.  The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture has been used to model cognitive agents in many domains, including agriculture.  However, typical implementations of this architecture have represented beliefs symbolically, so uncertain beliefs are usually not catered for.  Here we show that a BDI architecture, enhanced with a dynamic decision network (DDN), suitably models sugarcane grower agents’ repeated daily decisions.  Using two complex scenarios, we demonstrate that the agent selects the appropriate intention, and suggests how the grower should act adaptively and proactively to achieve his goals.  In addition, we provide a mapping for using a DDN in a BDI architecture.  This architecture can be used for modelling sugarcane grower agents in an agent-based simulation.  The mapping of the DDN’s use in the BDI architecture enables this work to be applied to other domains for modelling agents’ repeated decisions in partially observable, stochastic and dynamic environments.},

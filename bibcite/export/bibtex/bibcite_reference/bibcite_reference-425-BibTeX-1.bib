  title = {An Agent Architecture for Knowledge Discovery and Evolution},
  abstract = {The abductive theory of method (ATOM) was recently proposed to describe the process that scientists use for knowledge discovery. In this paper we propose an agent architecture for knowledge discovery and evolution (KDE) based on ATOM. The agent incorporates a combination of ontologies, rules and Bayesian networks for representing different aspects of its internal knowledge. The agent uses an external AI service to detect unexpected situations from incoming observations. It then uses rules to analyse the current situation and a Bayesian network for finding plausible explanations for unexpected situations. The architecture is evaluated and analysed on a use case application for monitoring daily household electricity consumption patterns.},

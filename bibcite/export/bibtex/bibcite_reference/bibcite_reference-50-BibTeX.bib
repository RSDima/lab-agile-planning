  title = {Using Formal Ontologies in the Development of Countermeasures for Military Aircraft},
  abstract = {Aircraft are valuable asset to the military and must be protected
against different threats. One such a threat is shoulder-launched
missiles which are portable, easy to use and easy to come by. To counter
this the military deploy various kinds of countermeasures on aircraft
against these attacks. In order to assist in the development, evaluation
and deployment of the countermeasures, modeling and simulation are
used. One such a system is the Optronic Scene Simulator, an engineering
tool used to model and evaluate infra-red countermeasures to make
recommendations for the deployment thereof. Ontologies are no longer a
foreign concept in the computer and information sciences eld - it plays a
valuable role in making systems more valuable. An ontology, Simtology,
was developed to support the the simulation system in various ways such
as providing a shared vocabulary, improve understanding of the concepts
in the environment and add value through suitable functionality.},

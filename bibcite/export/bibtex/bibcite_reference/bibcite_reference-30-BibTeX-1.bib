  title = {Bidirectional reachability-based modules},
  abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for MinA extraction in EL based on bidirectional reachability. We obtain a significant reduction in the size of modules extracted at almost no additional cost to that of extracting standard reachability-based modules. Bidirectional modules are related to nested locality modules, but are aimed specifically at MinA extraction and are generally smaller. For acyclic EL TBoxes consisting of only primitive concept inclusions, all MinAs can be extracted without the need for subsumption testing.},

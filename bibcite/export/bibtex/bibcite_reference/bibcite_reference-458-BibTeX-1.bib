  title = {A Comparison of Project Management in System and Research Projects},
  abstract = {Project management is one of the oldest management processes with reference already to project management during the building of the pyramids. However, the current form of project management with the support of different tools such as electronic management systems, is relatively new. Although there are different project types the processes, principals and successes of these types might differ. In this research we are interested in the differences and similarities between system development projects and research projects. In our investigation we used a systematic review where we used a coding schema to identify themes in the two types of projects. In comparing the two types of projects, it was found that processes and principals do compare in several themes in the number of references to the themes, but the success factors for the two types of projects are significantly different.},

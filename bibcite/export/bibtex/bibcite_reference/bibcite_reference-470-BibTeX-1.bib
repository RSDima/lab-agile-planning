  title = {Towards the use of formal ontologies in Enterprise Architecture framework repositories},
  abstract = {An enterprise architecture (EA) framework is a conceptual tool that assists organizations and businesses with the understanding of their own structure and the way they work. Normally an enterprise architecture framework takes the form of a comprehensive set of cohesive models or enterprise architectures that describe the structure and the functions of an enterprise. Generically, an architecture model is the description of the set of components and the relationships between them. The central idea of all architectures is to represent, or model (in the abstract) an orderly arrangement of the components that make up the system under question and the relationships between these components. It is clear within this context that the models within an enterprise architecture framework are complex. However, recent advances in ontologies and ontology technologies may provide the means to assist architects with the management of this complexity. In this position paper we want to argue for the integration of formal ontologies and ontology technologies as tools into enterprise architecture frameworks. Ontologies allow for the construction of complex conceptual models, but more significant, ontologies can assist an architect by depicting all the consequences of her model, allowing for more precise and complete artefacts within enterprise architecture framework repositories, and because these models use standardized languages, they will promote integration and interoperability with and within these repositories.},

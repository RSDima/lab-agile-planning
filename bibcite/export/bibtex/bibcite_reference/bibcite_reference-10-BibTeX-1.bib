  title = {An Interoperability Architecture for the Health Information Exchange in Rwanda},
  abstract = {Rwanda, one of the smallest and most densely populated countries in Africa, has made rapid and substantial progress towards designing and deploying a national health information system. One of the challenging aspects of the system is the design of an architecture to support: interoperability between existing health information systems already in use in the country; incremental extension into a full integrated national health information system without substantial reengineering;and scaling, from a single district in the initial phase, to national level without requiring a fundamental change in technology or design paradigm. This paper describes the key requirements and the design of the current architecture using ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard architecture descriptions. The architecture is based on the Enterprise Service Bus architectural model. We also describe a partial implementation of the architecture, and give a preliminary analysis based on our experiences.},

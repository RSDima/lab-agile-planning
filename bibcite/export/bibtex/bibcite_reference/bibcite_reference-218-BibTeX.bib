  title = {On the semantics of regular expression parsing in the wild},
  abstract = {We introduce prioritized transducers to formalize capturing groups in regular expression
matching in a way that permits straightforward modeling of capturing in Javaâ€™s 1 regular
expression library. The broader questions of parsing semantics and performance are also
considered. In addition, the complexity of deciding equivalence of regular expressions with
capturing groups is investigated.},

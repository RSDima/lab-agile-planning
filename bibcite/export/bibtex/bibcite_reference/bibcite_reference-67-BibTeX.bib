  title = {Towards Rational Closure for Fuzzy Logic: The Case of  Propositional Godel Logic},
  abstract = {In the field of non-monotonic logics, the notion of rational closure is acknowledged as a landmark and we are going to see whether such a construction can be adopted in the context of mathematical fuzzy logic, a so far (apparently) unexplored journey. As a first step, we will characterise rational closure in the context of Propositional Godel Logic.},

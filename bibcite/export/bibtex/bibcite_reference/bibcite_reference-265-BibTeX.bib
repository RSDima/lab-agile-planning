  title = {Efficient pattern matching in degenerate strings with the Burrows–Wheeler transform},
  abstract = {A degenerate or indeterminate string on an alphabet SIGMA is a sequence of non-empty subsets of SIGMA . Given a degenerate string t of length n and its Burrows–Wheeler transform we present a new method for searching for a degenerate pattern of length m in t running in O ( mn ) time on a constant size alphabet SIGMA. Furthermore, it is a hybrid pattern matching technique that works on both regular and degenerate strings. A degenerate string is said to be conservative if its number of non-solid letters is upper-bounded by a fixed positive constant q; in this case we show that the search time complexity is O ( qm^2 ) for counting
the number of occurrences and O ( qm^2 + occ ) for reporting the found occurrences where occ is the number of occurrences of the pattern in t. Experimental results show that our method performs well in practice.},

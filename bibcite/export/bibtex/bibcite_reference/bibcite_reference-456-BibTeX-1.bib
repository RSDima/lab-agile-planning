  abstract = {The concept of psychological ownership where someone can identify something as their own is part of every person's life. Psychological ownership is important because someone that own something take responsibility for its wellbeing. Currently there is no mechanism to measure psychological ownership of equipment within the context of small entrepreneurial business in South Africa. In this MOSAIC-2B project case study cinema-in-a-backpack equipment was given to entrepreneurs to empower them to start their own successful businesses screening multi-media content in rural South Africa. This research aimed to identify whether or not individuals developed psychological ownership towards the cinema equipment and what the possible effects of having psychological ownership could be. This study resulted in the development of a measuring tool for psychological ownership in the context of small entrepreneurial businesses in South Africa. Psychological ownership can give valuable insight into how entrepreneurs run their businesses in South Africa and this study also established that individuals that perceive themselves as successful has a higher indication of psychological ownership.},

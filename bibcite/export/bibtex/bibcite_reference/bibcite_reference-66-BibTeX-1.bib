  abstract = {The Object Role Modeling language (ORM2) is nowadays the most widespread fact-based conceptual modeling language in the business world. Recently, it has been proposed an encoding of the core fragment of ORM2 (called ORM2zero) into the description logic ALCQI, allowing the use of reasoning technologies in the analysis of the schemas. A number of services have been defined there based on the FO semantics of ORM2. On the other hand, in many application domains there is a need for the formalization and modeling of defeasible information and non-monotonic reasoning services. Here we formalize a possible way of introducing non-monotonic reasoning into ORM2 schemas, enriching the language with a special set of new constraints.},

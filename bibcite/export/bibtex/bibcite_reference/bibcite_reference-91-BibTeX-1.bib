  title = {Transition Constraints for Temporal Attributes},
  abstract = {Representing temporal data in conceptual data models and ontologies
is required by various application domains. For it to be useful for modellers to
represent the information precisely and reason over it, it is essential to have a language
that is expressive enough to capture the required operational semantics of
the time-varying information. Temporal modelling languages have little support
for temporal attributes, if at all, yet attributes are a standard element in the widely
used conceptual modelling languages such as EER and UML. This hiatus prevents
one to utilise a complete temporal conceptual data model and keep track of
evolving values of data and its interaction with temporal classes. A rich axiomatisation
of fully temporised attributes is possible with a minor extension to the
already very expressive description logic language DLRUS. We formalise the
notion of transition of attributes, and their interaction with transition of classes.
The transition specified for attributes are extension, evolution, and arbitrary quantitative
extension.},

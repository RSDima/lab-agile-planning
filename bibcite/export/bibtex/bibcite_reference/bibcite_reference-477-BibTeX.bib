  abstract = {The immense growth in mobile technology has opened various opportunities, both in marketing and in M-Commerce applications. The growth in these applications is according to the system of systems concept through which technologies such as cell phone networks are becoming integrated with other systems such as the Internet. Unfortunately, this may also lead to a new security risk, the use of mobile technology, more specifically the distribution of short message service (SMS) messages, to conduct phishing attacks. We demonstrate four types of phishing activities that can take place via mobile technology and provide a specific example on one of the introduced types.},

  abstract = {Design science research (DSR) is a popular research approach used in information systems for the design, development and evaluation of artefacts. There is some guidance in the literature on how to conduct DSR as an approach to find solutions for wicked problems. Some of the areas with which students who are involved in DSR struggle are the confirmation of the problem and design and evaluation of the artefact. Hevner et al. [1] presented their conceptual model for DSR in 2004 and in this paper we use this seminal work as guidance to illustrate where there is potential for inclusion of data collection activities to
address these three areas of concern. We also indicate the nature of the data collection that can be used during these phases. Lastly, we use some cases studies to map the areas that we have identified to these case studies as illustration. },

  title = {Enterprise Architecture for Small and Medium Enterprise Growth},
  abstract = {A key constraint for growing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is the business skills required to grow the enterprises through the stages of transformation. Criticism against growth stage models for SMEs is of concern, since these models contain the typical knowledge that appeals to managers of small enterprises as guidance in how to manage growth. In this article we propose the SMEAG model to explore the relevance of enterprise architecture (EA) for enhancing existing growth stage models in order to counteract some of this criticism. EA is well-known as a field that claims to manage change and complexity. The rationale to combine the concepts of growth stage models and EA is based on the level of change and complexity associated with the growth of small enterprises into medium enterprises. SMEAG combines the existing growth stage model of Scott and Bruce, the Enterprise Architecture Framework by Hoogervorst, and the EA as Foundation for Business Execution Model by Ross, Weill and Robertson.},

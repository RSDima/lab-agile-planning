  title = {A normal form for hypergraph-based module extraction for SROIQ},
  abstract = {Modularization is an important part of the modular design and maintenance of large scale ontologies. Syntactic locality-based mod-ules, with their desirable model theoretic properties, play an ever in-creasing role in the design of algorithms for modularization, partitioning and reasoning tasks such as classication. It has been shown that, for
the DL EL+, the syntactic locality module extraction problem is equiv-alent to the reachability-based problem for hypergraphs. In this paper we investigate and introduce a normal form for the DL SROIQ which allows us to map any SROIQ ontology to an equivalent hypergraph. We then show that standard hyperpath searching algorithms can be used to
extract syntactic locality based modules for SROIQ ontologies.},

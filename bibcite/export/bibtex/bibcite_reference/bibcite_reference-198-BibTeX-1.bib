  title = {Maximizing Expected Impact in an Agent Reputation Network},
  abstract = {We propose a new framework for reasoning about the reputation of multiple agents, based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). It is general enough for the specification of a variety of stochastic multi-agent system (MAS) domains involving the impact of agents on each other’s reputations. Assuming that an agent must maintain a good enough reputation to survive in the system, a method for an agent to select optimal actions is developed.},

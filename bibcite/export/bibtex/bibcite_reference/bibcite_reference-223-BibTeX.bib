  title = {Forrester’s paradox using typicality},
  abstract = {Deontic logic is a logic often used to formalise scenarios in the legal domain. Within the legal domain there are many exceptions and conflicting obligations. This motivates the enrichment of deontic logic with a notion of typicality which is based on defeasibility, with defeasibility allowing for reasoning about exceptions. Propositional Typicality Logic (PTL) is a logic that employs typicality. Deontic paradoxes are often used to examine logic systems as they provide undesirable results even if the scenarios seem intuitive. Forrester’s paradox is one of the most famous of these paradoxes. This paper shows that PTL can be used to represent and reason with Forrester’s paradox in such a way as to block undesirable conclusions without sacrificing desirable deontic properties.},

  title = {Using the Interaction model to compare ontological similarity between business units},
  abstract = {Enterprise engineering is an enterprise design methodology that uses a process to create an organised whole, while mastering complexity. Dietz proposes an organisation theorem that reduces complexity by representing the heterogeneous enterprise system as a layered integration of three homogeneous aspect systems: the ontological, infological and datalogical. The ontological aspect system represents the essence of enterprise operation and a starting point for engineering a complex enterprise. This paper applies one of the key ontological models, namely the interaction model, to assess its ability to indentify replication potential due to ontological similarity. The case study environment for application of the interaction model was four departments at a tertiary education institution.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the effects of subversive agents on the effectiveness of consensus-seeking processes.
A subversive agent can try and commit industrial espionage, or, could be a disgruntled employee. The ability
of an organisation to effectively execute projects, especially projects within large and complex organisation
such as those found in large corporates, governments and military institutions, depend on team members
reaching consensus on everything from the project vision through various design phases and eventually project
implementation and realisation. What could the effect be of agents trying to subvert such a process in a way
that does not raise suspicions? Such an agent cannot openly sabotage the project, but rather tries to influence
others in a way that increases the time it takes to reach consensus, thus delaying projects in subtle ways. Here
we explore the effect such agents could have on the time and effort to reach consensus though the use of a
stochastic Multi-Agent-Simulation (MAS).},

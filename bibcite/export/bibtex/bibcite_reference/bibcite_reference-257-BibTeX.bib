  title = {Ontology-Based Spatial Pattern Recognition in Diagrams},
  abstract = {Diagrams are widely used in our day to day communication. A knowledge of the spatial patterns used in diagrams is essential to read and understand them. In the context of diagrams, spatial patterns mean accepted spatial arrangements of graphical and textual elements used to represent diagram-speciﬁc concepts. In order to assist with the automated understanding of diagrams by computer applications, this paper presents an ontology-based approach to recognise diagram-speciﬁc concepts from the spatial patterns in diagrams. Speciﬁcally, relevant spatial patterns of diagrams are encoded in an ontology, and the automated instance classiﬁcation feature of the ontology reasoners is utilised to map spatial patterns to diagram-speciﬁc concepts depicted in a diagram. A prototype of this approach to support automated recognition of UML and domain concepts from class diagrams and its performance are also discussed in this paper. This paper concludes with a reﬂection of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.},

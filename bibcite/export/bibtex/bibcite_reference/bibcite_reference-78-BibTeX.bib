  title = {Dealing with Incomplete Transition Information in a Stochastic Action Logic},
  abstract = {We investigate the requirements for specifying the behaviors of actions in a stochastic domain. That is, we propose how to write sentences in a logical language to capture a model of stochastic transitions due to the execution of actions of some agent. We propose a definition for `proper' and `complete' probabilistic transition model specifications and suggest which assumptions can and perhaps should be made about such specifications to make them more parsimonious. Making a priori or default assumptions about the nature of transitions is useful when a given transition model is not fully specified. Two default assumption approaches will be considered.},

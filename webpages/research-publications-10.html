            <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption has increased significantly. The adoption rate of blockchain-based technologies has surpassed the Internet adoption rate in the 90s and early 2000s.

The generally limited understanding of how cryptocurrencies operate has increased the possible number of scams, relying on people’s misplaced sense of trust and desire for making money quickly and easily.

            <p>Data analysis-based decision-making is performed daily by
domain experts. As data grows, getting access to relevant data becomes a
challenge. In an approach known as Ontology-based data access (OBDA), AQ1
ontologies are advocated as a suitable formal tool to address complex
data access. This technique combines a domain ontology with a data
source by using a declarative mapping specification to enable data access
using a domain vocabulary.We investigate this approach by studying the
theoretical background; conducting a literature review on the implementation
of OBDA in production systems; implementing OBDA on a relational
dataset using an OBDA tool and; providing results and analysis of

Ontop is an open-source OBDA tool applied in the domain of relational
databases. The implementation consists of the GHTorrent dataset and
an extended SemanGit ontology. We perform a set of queries to highlight
a subset of the features of this data access approach. The results look
positive and can assist various use cases related to GitHub data with
a semantic approach. OBDA does provide benefits in practice, such as
querying in domain vocabulary and making use of reasoning over the
axioms in the ontology. However, the practical impediments we observe
are in the “manual” development of a domain ontology and the creation
of a mapping specification which requires deep knowledge of a domain
and the data. Also, implementing OBDA within the practical context
of an information system requires careful consideration for a suitable
user interface to facilitate the query construction from ontology vocabulary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;abstract = &#123;Data analysis-based decision-making is performed daily by
domain experts. As data grows, getting access to relevant data becomes a
challenge. In an approach known as Ontology-based data access (OBDA), AQ1
ontologies are advocated as a suitable formal tool to address complex
data access. This technique combines a domain ontology with a data
source by using a declarative mapping specification to enable data access
using a domain vocabulary.We investigate this approach by studying the
theoretical background; conducting a literature review on the implementation
of OBDA in production systems; implementing OBDA on a relational
dataset using an OBDA tool and; providing results and analysis of
query answering.We selected Ontop (https://ontop-vkg.org) to illustrate

            <p>Building computational models of agents in dynamic, partially observable and stochastic environments is challenging.  We propose a cognitive computational model of sugarcane growers’ daily decision-making to examine sugarcane supply chain complexities.  Growers make decisions based on uncertain weather forecasts; cane dryness; unforeseen emergencies; and the mill’s unexpected call for delivery of a different amount of cane.  The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture has been used to model cognitive agents in many domains, including agriculture.  However, typical implementations of this architecture have represented beliefs symbolically, so uncertain beliefs are usually not catered for.  Here we show that a BDI architecture, enhanced with a dynamic decision network (DDN), suitably models sugarcane grower agents’ repeated daily decisions.  Using two complex scenarios, we demonstrate that the agent selects the appropriate intention, and suggests how the grower should act adaptively and proactively to achieve his goals.  In addition, we provide a mapping for using a DDN in a BDI architecture.  This architecture can be used for modelling sugarcane grower agents in an agent-based simulation.  The mapping of the DDN’s use in the BDI architecture enables this work to be applied to other domains for modelling agents’ repeated decisions in partially observable, stochastic and dynamic environments.</p>

            <p>We explore how machine learning (ML) and Bayesian networks (BNs) can be combined in a personal health agent (PHA) for the detection and interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. We propose a PHA that uses ECG data from wearables to monitor heart activity, and interprets and explains the observed readings. We focus on atrial fibrillation (AF), the commonest type of arrhythmia. The absence of a P-wave in an ECG is the hallmark indication of AF. Four ML models are trained to classify an ECG signal based on the presence or absence of the P-wave: multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. The MLP is the best performing model with an accuracy of 89.61% and an F1 score of 88.68%. A BN representing AF risk factors is developed based on expert knowledge from the literature and evaluated using Pitchforth and Mengersen’s validation framework. The P-wave presence or absence as determined by the ML model is input into the BN. The PHA is evaluated using sample use cases to illustrate how the BN can explain the occurrence of AF using diagnostic reasoning. This gives the most likely AF risk factors for the individual</p>

Previous empirical studies have shown that human reasoning is consistent with non-monotonic logic and postulates of defeasible reasoning, belief revision and belief update. We extended previous work, which tested natural language translations of the postulates of defeasible reasoning, belief revision and belief update with human reasoners via surveys, in three respects.
Firstly, we only tested postulates of belief revision and belief update, taking the position that belief change aligns more with human reasoning than non-monotonic defeasible reasoning. Secondly, we decomposed the postulates of revision and update into material implication statements of the form “If x is the case, then y is the case”, each containing a premise
and a conclusion, and then translated the premises and conclusions into natural language. Thirdly, we asked human participants to judge each component of the postulate for plausibility. In our analysis, we measured the strength of the association between the premises and the conclusion of each postulate. We used Possibility theory to determine whether the postulates hold with our participants in general. Our results showed that our participants’ reasoning is consistent with postulates of belief
revision and belief update when judging the premises and conclusion of the postulate separately.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent response by governments to introduce national lockdown regulations have confined individuals to their residential premises.

            <p>Many organisations turn to enterprise architecture (EA) to assist with the alignment of business and information technology. While some of these organisations succeed in the development and implementation of EA, many of them fail to manage EA after implementation. Because of the specific focus on the management of EA during and after the initial implementation, the enterprise architecture management (EAM) field is developed. EAM is characterised by many dimensions or elements. It is a challenge to select the dimensions that should be managed and that are vital for successful EA practice. In this study, we executed a systematic literature review (SLR) of primary EA and EAM literature with the aim of identifying dimensions regarded as key areas of EAM. The main contribution of this work is a concept map of the essential EAM dimensions with their relationships. The results of the SLR indicate that dimensions that used to be considered important or seemed to be the most essential for EA, such as frameworks, EA principles and reference models, are no longer emphasised as strongly and more focus is placed on people, skills, communication and governance when considering EAM literature and EAM maturity.</p>

In this study, we executed a systematic literature review (SLR) of primary EA and EAM literature with the aim of identifying dimensions regarded as key areas of EAM. The main contribution of this work is a concept map of the essential EAM dimensions with their relationships. The results of the SLR indicate that dimensions that used to be considered important or seemed to be the most essential for EA, such as frameworks, EA principles and reference models, are no longer emphasised as strongly and more focus is placed on people, skills, communication and governance when considering EAM literature and EAM maturity.&#125;,
